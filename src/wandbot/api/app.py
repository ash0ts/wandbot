"""This module serves as the main server API for the wandbot application.

It imports and uses the FastAPI framework to define the API and initialize application event handlers like "startup".
Also, the module includes Python's built-in asyncio library for managing asynchronous tasks related to database backup.

The API includes:
- APICreateChatThreadRequest
- APIFeedbackRequest
- APIFeedbackResponse
- APIGetChatThreadResponse
- APIQueryRequest
- APIQueryResponse
- APIQuestionAnswerRequest
- APIQuestionAnswerResponse

Following classes and their functionalities:
- Chat: Main chat handling class, initialized during startup.
- ChatConfig: Configuration utility for chat.
- ChatRequest: Schema to handle requests made to the chat.

It also sets up and interacts with the database through:
- DatabaseClient: A utility to interact with the database.
- Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine): Creates database tables based on the metadata.

The server runs periodic backup of the data to wandb using the backup_db method which runs as a coroutine.
The backup data is transformed into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a wandb.Table.

It uses logger from the utils module for logging purposes.
