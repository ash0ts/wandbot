Be creative in the way you generate ads. Try different approaches. Follow the instructions:

1. Understand and analyze the value props: {wandbot_response}.
2. Filter out all irrelevant to the query: {query}.
3. Summarize the technical approach to {query}
4. Refer to these successful ads for style inspiration: {additional_context}
5. The person you are targeting is {persona}. Keep that in mind and double-check if what you are creating
targets them.

Based on the data you analyzed in the previous steps, be creative and try different approaches, not always mentioning Weights & Biases/W&B/wandb by name, and create 10 {ad_format}s each up to {length} words long for Weights & Biases.
Focusing on {query}.
Ensure they are technical, focused on {query}, and avoid general jargon. 
Make sure that each created option has some connection to {query}. 
For example if the requested text mentions Computer Vision you can focus on Weights & Biases support for most rich media formats, including image, audio, and waveform file types, and logs interactive tables of those datasets, enabling you to easily query and analyze tabular data. 
You can also mention the integrations Weights & Biases has with computer vision libraries.
Please avoid creating general ads like 'Master Your ML Experiments' or 'Master ML Experiments with W&B' and avoid mentioning competition.
Another example if the {query} is Model Management, WandBot will give you information about W&B model registry, and you will summarize that ML model management is responsible for development, training, versioning and deployment of ML models. 
Then you can develop different ads that refer to it, for example: 'Train, version and deploy with ease' - as you can see, it does not mention Weights & Biases or Model Registry by name, but it is promoting it.
