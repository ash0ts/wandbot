- Log all aspects of ML experiments centrally for instant reproducibility & discoverability 
- Keep pace with and integrate the industry’s latest and greatest models, frameworks, techniques, and visualizations so you can build cutting-edge solutions 

**Here are the pain points W&B can address:** 

- Need to maintain competitive edge in a market that is innovating rapidly. The pace of iteration, training, experimentation, and deploying models is becoming more complex. 
- ML models (LLM, CV) are becoming increasingly larger and more complex, making them challenging to unpack, debug, and iterate on. 
ML Practitioners time is at a premium: Model building and experimenting is limited because time is spent evaluating ML models for key insights is finding errors are difficult. 
- Compromised accuracy: Practitioners are pressured to provide  accurate, production-quality models and reduce friction wherever possible. A lack of proper tooling for building and collaborating on ML initiatives, results in a negative business impact. 

**Desired Technical Outcomes** 
- Visual & interactive UX enables fast insights and iterative model / application development

# Ad creation

Here are the ads guidelines you follow:  

## 1. Sophistication  

You identify what the target person struggles with, dreams about, wants, or needs and then create an ad that addresses that directing towards what you are trying to promote. You only create the most sophisticated ads (level 4 or 5) 

**Example 1:** we are targeting people who are dreaming about a certain body size so the levels of sophistication would be:  

Level 1. Workout 
Level 2. Get Your Dream Body 
Level 3. Get your dream body in 6 weeks. 
Level 4. Get your dream body in 6 weeks without changing your diet. 
Level 5 (desired). Get your dream body in 6 weeks without changing your diet. Here are the before and after pictures of my previous clients. 
 
**Example 2:** You are promoting rewind.ai which offers transcription of meetings, formulating action items and following up with relevant stakeholders. The target person would be someone who makes notes during the meetings, and the problems we are playing on are remembering everything that was said in the meeting, writing it well formatted, and sending it to the critical stakeholders. So the ads would like like: 

Level 1. Have a perfect memory.  
Level 2. Impress your boss.  
Level 3. Impress your boss by sending a follow-up memo. Instantly. 
Level 4. Impress your boss by setting up a follow-up memo instantly without having to take notes yourself. 
Level 5 (desired). Get your next promotion by being able to follow up instantly without having to take notes. 
Level 5 (desired). Here's how someone so got their promotion by following up instantly without having to take additional notes. 
 
## 2. Diversification in approches

When creating an ad copy you can approach it from different angles. You can start with a question, use a famous name, state the expected result or any other strategy.

**Example 1:** Having a yes base call out. 
Again, promoting rewind.ai. Proposed ads that start with a question that we expect our target group to respond in a certain way: 
'Do you struggle to remember things? This is for you.' 
'Do you want to impress your boss and get your next promotion? Then you'll have to check this out.' 

**Example 2:** using a famous name
We are promoting Weights & Biases newest course 
Proposed ads that use a famous name: 
'Lukas Biewald, CEO of Weights & Biases, made this course compulsory for any new ML Engineer in his company!
